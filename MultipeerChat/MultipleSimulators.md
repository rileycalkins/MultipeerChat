#  Multiple Simulators


To run your app on multiple simulators (e.g., iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Max, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max) simultaneously using a script, you'll typically use the xcodebuild command to build your app and xcrun simctl to manage simulators. This process involves several steps: building your app for the simulator, finding the UDIDs of the simulators you want to use, installing the app on those simulators, and then launching the app.

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up such a script:

1. Open Terminal
Start by opening the Terminal app on your Mac.

2. Navigate to Your Project Directory
Use the cd command to navigate to your project directory.

sh
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
3. Build Your App for the Simulator
First, you need to build your app with xcodebuild targeting the iOS Simulator. You can do this using a command like:

sh
Copy code
xcodebuild build -scheme YourSchemeName -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14,OS=latest' -derivedDataPath './build'
Replace YourSchemeName with the name of your app's scheme. The -derivedDataPath option specifies where to put the build artifacts, making it easier to find the .app bundle you'll need to install on the simulators.

4. Find the Simulator UDIDs
You need the UDIDs (Unique Device Identifiers) of the simulators you want to run your app on. You can list all available simulators and their UDIDs with the following command:

sh
Copy code
xcrun simctl list devices available
Look through the output for the devices you're interested in and note down their UDIDs.

5. Install the App on Each Simulator
Now, use xcrun simctl to install your app on each simulator using their UDIDs. You'll need to find the path to the .app bundle in the ./build directory (or wherever you chose to output the build artifacts).

iPhone 15 (2C32FE56-948E-4EB3-9F01-99E0D98D5A28) (Shutdown) 
    iPhone 15 Plus (8F0F7E18-3072-42E9-853F-4520904DA4D2) (Booted) 
    iPhone 15 Pro (2FEBAC39-AE4B-41C9-A539-A7366BB12DE9) (Shutdown) 
    iPhone 15 Pro Max (89F178FC-499A-43FB-9EAD-1803DA7EF7C6) (Booted) 

sh
Copy code
xcrun simctl install <device_udid> path/to/yourApp.app
Replace <device_udid> with the actual UDID of the simulator and path/to/yourApp.app with the actual path to your .app bundle.

6. Launch the App on Each Simulator
After installing, you can launch your app on each simulator using:

sh
Copy code
xcrun simctl launch <device_udid> com.example.yourAppBundleId
Replace <device_udid> with the simulator's UDID and com.example.yourAppBundleId with your app's bundle identifier.

Automating the Process
To automate steps 5 and 6 for multiple simulators, you can create a shell script. Here's an example script that installs and launches an app on four different simulators:

sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Path to the built .app
APP_PATH="path/to/yourApp.app"

# Your app's bundle identifier
BUNDLE_ID="com.example.yourAppBundleId"

# Array of simulator UDIDs
SIMULATORS=("UDID_of_iPhone14" "UDID_of_iPhone14Max" "UDID_of_iPhone14Pro" "UDID_of_iPhone14ProMax")

for UDID in "${SIMULATORS[@]}"
do
    echo "Installing app on simulator with UDID: $UDID"
    xcrun simctl install $UDID "$APP_PATH"
    echo "Launching app on simulator with UDID: $UDID"
    xcrun simctl launch $UDID $BUNDLE_ID
done

echo "Done."
Replace path/to/yourApp.app, com.example.yourAppBundleId, and the simulator UDIDs with your specific details. Save this script to a file, make it executable with chmod +x filename.sh, and then run it from the terminal.

Remember, the specific commands and paths may vary based on your project configuration and where your build artifacts are located.
