#  ReconnectingUsersMPC

The Multipeer Connectivity (MC) framework does not inherently support automatically reconnecting to peers (other devices) that you have previously connected with after the app is restarted. The framework is designed for dynamic discovery and connection of nearby devices while the app is running. Once the app is terminated or connections are dropped, you must rediscover and reconnect to peers.

However, you can implement a strategy to streamline reconnecting to previously connected peers. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

Persist Peer Identifiers: When you establish a connection with a peer, save the displayName of the MCPeerID to persistent storage (e.g., UserDefaults or a database). This identifier should be unique enough to recognize the peer later.
Attempt to Reconnect: When your app starts, or when you navigate to the relevant view, read the stored identifiers and attempt to reconnect to those peers. Since MCPeerID instances cannot be directly saved and retrieved (they do not conform to Codable), you'll create new MCPeerID instances with the saved display names.
Advertise and Browse for Peers: Make sure that your app starts advertising its presence and browsing for other devices as soon as it's appropriate to do so. This way, it can be discovered by other devices and can discover them.
Automatically Initiate Connections: When you discover a peer whose displayName matches one of the saved identifiers, automatically initiate a connection to this peer.
Here's a simplified example of how you might implement parts of this strategy:

Step 1: Save Connected Peer Identifiers
When a connection is successfully established, save the displayName of the MCPeerID.

swift
Copy code
func saveConnectedPeerIdentifier(_ peerID: MCPeerID) {
    var connectedPeers = UserDefaults.standard.stringArray(forKey: "ConnectedPeers") ?? []
    if !connectedPeers.contains(peerID.displayName) {
        connectedPeers.append(peerID.displayName)
        UserDefaults.standard.set(connectedPeers, forKey: "ConnectedPeers")
    }
}
Step 2: Attempt to Reconnect to Saved Peers
When your app starts or when it's appropriate to reconnect to peers:

swift
Copy code
func attemptReconnectToSavedPeers() {
    let savedPeerDisplayNames = UserDefaults.standard.stringArray(forKey: "ConnectedPeers") ?? []
    // Assuming you have a method to start browsing or advertising
    startBrowsingForPeers()
    startAdvertisingToPeers()

    // `savedPeerDisplayNames` would be used to compare against discovered peer display names
    // If a match is found, automatically initiate a connection
}
Handling Discovery and Connection
Modify your discovery delegate methods to automatically initiate connections with saved peers.

swift
Copy code
func browser(_ browser: MCNearbyServiceBrowser, foundPeer peerID: MCPeerID, withDiscoveryInfo info: [String : String]?) {
    let savedPeerDisplayNames = UserDefaults.standard.stringArray(forKey: "ConnectedPeers") ?? []
    if savedPeerDisplayNames.contains(peerID.displayName) {
        // This is a previously connected peer, automatically initiate connection
        browser.invitePeer(peerID, to: self.session, withContext: nil, timeout: 10)
    }
}
Caveats and Considerations
User Privacy and Security: Always consider privacy and security implications, especially when automatically connecting to devices. Ensure that your use of the Multipeer Connectivity framework complies with Apple's guidelines and respects user privacy.
Dynamic Nature of Peer-to-Peer Connections: Peer identifiers are based on display names, which might not be unique or could change. For a more robust solution, consider implementing custom verification after connecting to ensure peers are truly the ones previously connected with.
Connection Stability: This approach does not guarantee that connections will always be re-established, as it depends on the dynamic discovery process and the availability of the peers.
This strategy is a workaround to facilitate a smoother reconnection process with previously connected peers but remember the inherent limitations and design of the Multipeer Connectivity framework for dynamic peer discovery and connections.
